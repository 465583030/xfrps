## What is xfrps and why xfrps

xfrps was [xfrp](https://github.com/KunTengRom/xfrp)'s server, it was a branch of [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) which mainly focus on serving amount of routers and IOT devices 

The reason to start xfrps project is the following: 
1, we need a stable frp server to serve our [xfrp](https://github.com/KunTengRom/xfrp), however frp change very fast, high version of frp doesn't promise compatible with low version 
2, frp's roadmap doesn't satisfy xfrp's need, for example, ftp support is important for us, but frp didn't support it
3, by maintaining our own frp server project, we can develope our own feature, no need to wait frp's support
